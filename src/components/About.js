         <p>Brakebills University was established in Upstate New York in 1763 and became the
           standard-bearer of the American high society, having given rise to generation after generation of
           educated statesmen.
           <br></br>
           <br></br>  By the 1920s Brakebills taught English and American studies almost exclusively, and as such,
           lacked a diverse student body until a vogue for multicultural students swept the school in the '30s and '40s, and the
           school imported professors from all around, including Dean Mayakovsky and Professor Neeny Bigby. The school
           recruited skirt-wearing shamans from Micronesian dot-islands; hunch-shouldered, hookah-puffing Anthropologists from inner-city Cairo
           coffeehouses; and blue-faced Tuareg philosophers from southern Morocco.

       <br></br>The banning of Battlefield Strategy
       In 1879, Brakebills provided training in Battlefield Strategy to its students, and Professor Neeny Bigby led the course during World War II, when
       Rupert Chatwin attended the school after he was discharged from the war due to his injuries. Neeny Bigby taught Chatwin how to build a fragment mine, a powerful weapon that required extremely precise engineering, which Chatwin used to win the Battle of the Bulge in 1945 for the
       Allied Powers. However, due to the high amount of student deaths in the 1970s, the course was banned by the Brakebills Board of Trustees, and Neeny Bigby was
       fired from the school.</p>

          <p>Brakebills University for Magical Pedagogy, also known as Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy, Brakebills Preparatory College of Magic, Brakebills Academy for Magical Pedagogy, or simply Brakebills, is the premier institution for the study of magic in North America.</p>

          <span className="about-page-quote"><p>"This school exists for a single and timeless purpose: to reveal your innate abilities and hone them to the highest degree. Now, what you do with it after that is entirely up to you. If you want to take over the world, we don't teach that, but give it a go."<br></br> â€•Dean Henry Fogg</p></span>

          <p>Brakebills University was established in Upstate New York in 1763 and became the 
            standard-bearer of the American magical society, having given rise to generation after generation of 
            illustrious Magicians. Using enchanted globes to find people with magical potential, the school evaluates 
            all potential students with scouts before sending them an invitation to take the Entrance Exam and determine
             whether or not they qualify for enrollment. Though the wards surrounding the school keep it hidden from civilians, 
             some have been known to make their way through the forest and onto campus grounds.</p>

        Rupert Chatwin attended the school after he was discharged from the war due to his injuries. Neeny Bigby taught Chatwin how to cast the Rhinemann

        Allied Powers. However, due to the high amount of student deaths in the 1970s, the course was banned by the Brakebills Board of Trustees, and Neeny Bigby was 
        fired from the school. Prior to leaving, however, Neeny Bigby left clues in the school's library for how to find her in the future when a Brakebills student would need her help.</p>
